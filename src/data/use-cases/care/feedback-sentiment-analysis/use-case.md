# Sentiment Analysis for Patient & Caregiver Feedback

**Short description**  
Analyze **free-text feedback** from patients, family members, and caregivers to detect **emotions, tone, and satisfaction signals**. The system classifies sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) and extracts key themes, enabling care organizations to **spot risks early**, improve service quality, and measure the impact of interventions.

## Business outcomes & KPIs
- **Early detection of dissatisfaction** → proactive resolution before escalation.
- **Improved quality of care** through actionable insights from real feedback.
- **Better compliance** with patient experience KPIs and accreditation standards.

**Example KPIs**  
% negative sentiment flagged and resolved, average response time to complaints, correlation between sentiment trends and incident rates, patient satisfaction score uplift.

## Beneficiaries
- **Quality & Safety teams** (monitor experience and safety signals).
- **Patient Relations / Complaints teams** (prioritize urgent cases).
- **Management** (track sentiment trends across units).
- **HR** (analyze staff feedback for well-being signals).

---

## Typical data sources
- **Patient surveys** (open-text fields).
- **Complaint forms** and **incident narratives**.
- **Chat transcripts** from digital care channels.
- **Social listening** (optional, if policy allows).

## Process
1. **Collect text data** from surveys, complaints, and chat logs.
2. **Preprocess**: language detection, anonymization, tokenization.
3. **Sentiment classification**: positive/neutral/negative or multi-class (e.g., anger, fear, trust).
4. **Theme extraction**: identify recurring topics (e.g., waiting time, staff attitude).
5. **Visualization & alerts**: dashboards with sentiment trends and drill-down to flagged cases.

## Modeling options
- **Rule-based + lexicon** for quick wins (e.g., VADER).
- **ML/Deep Learning**: transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa) fine-tuned for healthcare tone.
- **Explainability**: highlight phrases driving sentiment classification.

---

## Decision & action integration
- **Alerts** for strongly negative sentiment → trigger escalation workflow.
- **Dashboards** for management: sentiment by department, trend over time.
- **Integration** with quality improvement programs and HR well-being initiatives.

---

## Governance & risk
- **Privacy**: anonymize personal identifiers before analysis.
- **Bias**: monitor for language or cultural bias in sentiment models.
- **Transparency**: provide examples of why a text was classified as negative.

---

## Success criteria
- Reduction in unresolved complaints.
- Faster response to negative feedback.
- Positive correlation between sentiment improvement and patient satisfaction scores.

---

## Demo/POC outline
- **Scope**: 3–6 months of survey and complaint data.
- **Output**: dashboard with sentiment distribution and top themes.
- **Scenario**: simulate alert when negative sentiment spikes in a ward.

---

## Variants & extensions
- **Emotion detection** for victim support or mental health triage.
- **Real-time monitoring** of chat channels for escalation.
- **Combine with summarization** for executive reporting.
