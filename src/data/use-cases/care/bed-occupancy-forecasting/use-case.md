# Occupancy & Bed Capacity Forecasting

Hospitals face a daily challenge: ensuring enough beds and staff are available, without running into costly overcapacity. Long waiting times, overflow, and high flexible staffing costs directly impact both patient care and staff well-being. With **Occupancy & Bed Capacity Forecasting**, you gain a practical tool to anticipate demand and take action before problems arise.

## Details
Occupancy & Bed Capacity Forecasting predicts bed demand and staffing needs per unit or department, up to 28 days ahead. The model combines historical admissions, patient flows, and contextual factors (seasonality, holidays, epidemiological signals) to produce reliable forecasts. These are delivered through dashboards and alerts, designed to support daily operational decisions.

### Key aspects:
- **Data-driven**: admissions, patient flows, length of stay, and context factors combined.
- **Forecast models**: baseline statistical methods, enhanced with machine learning where beneficial.
- **Practical output**: forecast ranges and traffic-light signals to guide quick decisions.
- **Seamless integration**: connectable with workforce scheduling systems (e.g., Ortec) and existing planning processes.
- **Governance & safety**: privacy-by-design, role-based access, and human-in-the-loop decision validation.

### What this means for your organization:
- Stronger control over capacity and workload.
- Fewer ad-hoc interventions in rosters and admissions.
- Data-driven decisions for finance, HR, and operations.
