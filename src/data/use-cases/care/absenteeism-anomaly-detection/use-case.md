# Absenteeism Detection & Early Warning

**Short description**  
Detect unusual patterns in staff absenteeism at an early stage to enable proactive interventions. The system monitors historical absence data, team patterns, and contextual factors to identify anomalies that may indicate emerging risks (e.g., burnout, workload imbalance).

---

## Business outcomes & KPIs
- **Reduce unplanned absences** through early intervention.
- **Lower PNIL/flex costs** by preventing last-minute replacements.
- **Improve staff well-being** and retention.

**Example KPIs**  
Absenteeism rate (%), average duration of absence, anomaly detection precision/recall, intervention lead time.

---

## Beneficiaries
- **HR & Workforce planning** (preventive measures).
- **Operations** (better shift coverage).
- **Management** (cost control, employee engagement).

---

## Typical data & systems
- **HR systems**: absence logs, contract details (e.g., AFAS).
- **Roster systems**: planned vs. actual shifts (e.g., Ortec).
- **Contextual data**: workload indicators, overtime, team size.
- **Optional**: sentiment signals from surveys or internal tools.

## Process
1. **Collect data**: historical absence patterns by team/role.
2. **Feature engineering**: rolling averages, seasonality, workload metrics.
3. **Model**: anomaly detection (unsupervised or semi-supervised).
4. **Output**: alerts for unusual spikes or patterns.
5. **Integration**: dashboard for HR + automated notifications.

## Modeling options
- **Statistical**: control charts, z-score thresholds.
- **ML**: Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, autoencoders for complex patterns.
- **Evaluation**: precision/recall on historical anomalies, false positive rate.

---

## Decision & action integration
- **Alerts** to HR when anomaly detected.
- **Suggested actions**: workload review, team check-in, preventive health measures.
- **Reporting**: trends by department, root cause analysis.

---

## Governance & risk
- **Privacy**: handle personal data under GDPR; aggregate where possible.
- **Bias**: ensure fairness across roles and demographics.
- **Human oversight**: HR validates before action.

---

## Success criteria
- Reduction in unplanned absence rate.
- Faster detection â†’ earlier interventions.
- Positive feedback from HR and managers.

---

## Demo/POC outline
- **Dataset**: 12 months of absence logs + rosters.
- **Output**: dashboard with anomaly alerts and trend charts.
- **Scenario**: simulate sudden spike in a team.

---

## Variants & extensions
- Predictive absenteeism risk scoring (combine with forecasting).
- Link to **workforce optimization** for proactive scheduling.
- Integrate with **employee well-being programs**.
