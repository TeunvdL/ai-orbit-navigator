## Optimal Route Planning for Order Pickers

â€”**Short description**
Leverage AI and optimization algorithms to determine the most efficient picking routes for warehouse staff. The system analyzes order lists, warehouse layouts, and real-time inventory locations to minimize travel time and increase picking efficiency.

**Business outcomes & KPIs**
Reduced order picking time and labor costs.
Increased order fulfillment speed and accuracy.
Improved warehouse throughput and staff productivity.

**Example KPIs**
Average pick time per order, total distance traveled, order accuracy rate, labor cost per order.

**Beneficiaries**
Warehouse operators and order pickers
Logistics and operations managers

**Typical data & systems (examples)**
Warehouse management system (WMS)
Inventory databases
Real-time location tracking

**Process (from data to action)**
Ingest order lists and current inventory locations.
Map optimal picking routes using warehouse layout data.
Provide real-time route guidance to order pickers.
Continuously update routes based on inventory movement and new orders.

**Modeling options**
Route optimization algorithms (e.g., shortest path, TSP)
Reinforcement learning for dynamic environments

**Decision & action integration**
Route instructions delivered via handheld devices or mobile apps.
Integration with WMS for real-time updates.

**Governance, privacy & risk**
Access control for operational data.
Monitoring for route accuracy and picker feedback.

**Success criteria**
Consistent reduction in pick times and travel distances.
Positive feedback from warehouse staff.

**Variants & extensions**
Expand to multi-zone or multi-warehouse operations.
Integrate with automated picking systems.
