## Predictive Maintenance

—**Short description**
Predict equipment failures in industrial machines proactively by leveraging IoT sensor data (vibration, temperature, pressure, energy consumption). The system generates forecasts and actionable alerts to enable preventive maintenance, reduce unplanned downtime, and optimize operational efficiency.

**Business outcomes & KPIs**
Minimized unplanned downtime and associated production losses.
Optimized maintenance schedules, reducing labor and spare parts costs.
Improved Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) and throughput.
Enhanced operational safety through early detection of equipment issues.

**Example KPIs**
Machine uptime %, Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), Mean Time to Repair (MTTR), maintenance cost reduction, forecast accuracy (MAPE/MAE), number of unplanned stoppages avoided.

**Beneficiaries**
Maintenance engineers and technicians (scheduling & prioritization)
Operations managers (production continuity)
Finance/control teams (cost optimization)
Safety officers (risk mitigation)

**Typical data & systems (examples)**
Machine sensors: vibration, temperature, pressure, energy usage.
ERP/CMMS: maintenance logs, work orders, equipment metadata.
Contextual data: production schedules, environmental conditions, shift patterns.

**Process (from data to action)**
Ingest and clean historical sensor and maintenance data.
Feature engineering: rolling averages, peak detection, lag features.
Forecast potential failures using time-series models and anomaly detection.
Compute confidence intervals and maintenance thresholds.
Trigger actionable alerts for preventive interventions.
Publish dashboards and integrate predictions with CMMS/ERP for scheduling.

**Modeling options**
Classical: ARIMA, exponential smoothing.
ML: Gradient boosting, LSTM, isolation forests for anomaly detection.
Evaluation: backtesting, MTBF/MTTR improvement, coverage of prediction intervals.
Start with interpretable baseline models; expand to ML for consistent accuracy uplift.

**Decision & action integration**
Dashboards with real-time machine health, predicted failures, and traffic-light status.
Alerts for maintenance teams with recommended interventions.
API/ERP integration to automatically generate preventive maintenance orders (with human oversight).

**Governance, privacy & risk**
Role-based access control for operational and sensor data.
Versioning, drift monitoring, and retraining cadence for predictive models.
Human-in-the-loop for critical actions; prevent automated production shutdowns.

**Success criteria**
Sustained predictive accuracy, reduced unplanned downtime, measurable cost savings, and positive feedback from maintenance teams.

**Demo/POC outline**
Historical sensor data (12–24 months) for key machines.
Baseline vs. ML-enhanced predictions in dashboards.
Scenario analysis: peak production, environmental variation.
Mock integration with CMMS to demonstrate end-to-end value.

**Variants & extensions**
Scale across multiple machines or production lines.
Integrate spare parts inventory forecasts with predictive alerts.
Combine with production scheduling optimization to minimize disruptions.
