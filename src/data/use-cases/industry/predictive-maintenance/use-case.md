# Predictive Maintenance

Unexpected equipment failures can **halt production**, **drive up maintenance costs**, and **disrupt delivery schedules**. **Predictive Maintenance** leverages IoT sensor data to **identify potential failures** before they occur, helping organizations **plan interventions proactively** instead of reacting to breakdowns.

## Business outcomes & KPIs
- **Minimize unplanned downtime** → maintain steady production and reduce costly interruptions.  
- **Optimize maintenance schedules** → lower labor and spare-parts expenses.  
- **Increase efficiency and safety** → improve OEE while preventing equipment-related incidents.  
- **Enable data-driven decisions** → clear alerts and dashboards make insights actionable for technicians and managers.

## Details

Predictive Maintenance combines sensor data (vibration, temperature, pressure, energy use) with historical maintenance records to forecast when and where failures are likely to happen. The solution continuously analyzes equipment behavior, flags anomalies, and suggests the optimal time for maintenance—reducing both downtime and unnecessary preventive work.  

### Key aspects:
- **Comprehensive data foundation**: integrates IoT sensor streams, ERP/CMMS data, and production context.  
- **Advanced analytics**: uses time-series forecasting and anomaly detection to predict failures with high accuracy.  
- **Actionable output**: provides traffic-light alerts, recommended interventions, and scheduling integration.  
- **Seamless integration**: connects directly with ERP and maintenance management systems for streamlined planning.  
- **Controlled and transparent**: includes model versioning, performance monitoring, and human oversight for all automated alerts.  

**What this means for your organization:**  
- Reduced downtime and maintenance costs.  
- More reliable production planning and throughput.  
- Improved safety and equipment lifetime.  
- Stronger collaboration between maintenance, operations, and finance teams.
