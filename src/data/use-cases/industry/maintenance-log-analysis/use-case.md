## Business outcomes & KPIs 
- **Identify recurring issues faster** → prevent repeated failures.  
- **Optimize preventive maintenance** → improve equipment uptime and reliability.  
- **Reduce maintenance costs** → focus resources where they are most needed.  
- **Enable actionable insights** → dashboards highlight patterns and trends.

## Details

The solution aggregates unstructured maintenance logs, service reports, and operator notes, applying NLP techniques to extract equipment, symptoms, and actions. Patterns and recurring issues are visualized to guide maintenance decisions proactively.  

### Key aspects:
- **Data-driven insights**: integrates maintenance logs, CMMS/ERP metadata, and contextual production data.  
- **Advanced AI**: NER for equipment/failure extraction, relation mapping, clustering of recurring issues.  
- **Actionable output**: dashboards and alerts for recurring failure types.  
- **Seamless integration**: feeds insights into preventive maintenance scheduling.  
- **Controlled and transparent**: anonymization and human-in-the-loop review for critical insights.  

**What this means for your organization:**  
- Faster identification and resolution of recurring failures.  
- More targeted and cost-effective preventive maintenance.  
- Reduced downtime and operational disruption.  
- Data-driven collaboration between maintenance, operations, and quality teams.
