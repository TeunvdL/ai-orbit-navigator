## Maintenance Log Analysis & Root-Cause Extraction

—**Short description**
Automatically analyze unstructured maintenance logs, operator notes, and service reports to identify common failure causes and trends. NLP extracts key entities (equipment, symptoms, actions) and relations to provide actionable insights for maintenance planning and process improvement.

**Business outcomes & KPIs**
Faster identification of recurring equipment issues.
Improved preventive maintenance schedules based on data-driven root causes.
Reduced downtime and maintenance costs.

**Example KPIs**
Frequency of recurring failure types, average resolution time per issue, number of actionable insights generated, reduction in repeat failures.

**Beneficiaries**
Maintenance engineers & reliability teams
Operations managers (process improvement)
Quality and production managers

**Typical data & systems (examples)**
Maintenance logs, operator notes, service reports (text files, PDFs).
CMMS/ERP metadata: equipment IDs, timestamps, maintenance types.
Contextual production data to correlate issues.

**Process (from data to action)**
Aggregate historical maintenance logs and reports.
Preprocess text: tokenization, normalization, entity recognition.
Extract key entities (equipment, failure types, actions) and relationships.
Identify patterns and recurring issues using NLP clustering or classification.
Visualize root-cause insights in dashboards for decision-making.

**Modeling options**
Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract equipment and failure types.
Relation extraction to link actions with outcomes.
Clustering/classification to detect patterns and recurring issues.
Evaluation: precision/recall for entity extraction, accuracy of pattern detection.

**Decision & action integration**
Insights feed into maintenance planning dashboards.
Alerts for recurring failure types or unaddressed issues.
Integration with preventive maintenance scheduling in CMMS.

**Governance, privacy & risk**
Anonymization of operator names or sensitive information.
Versioning of NLP models to ensure consistent results.
Human-in-the-loop review for critical insights before automated action.

**Success criteria**
Accurate extraction of key issues, reduced repeat failures, actionable maintenance insights, positive feedback from engineers.

**Demo/POC outline**
Sample maintenance logs (6–12 months).
NLP pipeline extracting entities and root causes.
Dashboard showing trends, recurring issues, and suggested actions.

**Variants & extensions**
Extend to multilingual logs or operator reports.
Combine with predictive maintenance models to proactively prevent failures.
Integrate with IoT sensor data for enriched analysis.
