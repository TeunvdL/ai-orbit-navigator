## Demand Forecasting

—**Short description**
Predict demand for materials, spare parts, or finished goods using historical usage and sales data. Provides confidence intervals to optimize procurement, inventory, and production planning.

**Business outcomes & KPIs**
Reduced stockouts and overstock situations.
Optimized inventory turnover and working capital.
Improved production planning and supply chain efficiency.

**Example KPIs**
Forecast accuracy (MAPE/MAE), stockout frequency, inventory turnover, procurement cost savings, schedule adherence.

**Beneficiaries**
Supply chain planners
Procurement and materials management teams
Production managers
Finance/control for cost management

**Typical data & systems (examples)**
ERP/Inventory: historical sales, stock levels, purchase orders.
Production logs: throughput, batch sizes, downtime.
External context: seasonality, promotions, market trends.

**Process (from data to action)**
Aggregate historical usage and sales data.
Feature engineering: moving averages, seasonality, external drivers.
Forecast using statistical and ML models.
Compute confidence intervals and alert on low inventory.
Publish forecasts to dashboards and ERP systems for actionable planning.

**Modeling options**
Classical: ARIMA, ETS, Prophet.
ML: Gradient boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM), LSTM.
Evaluation: rolling-origin backtests, MAPE/MAE, bias.
Start simple, add ML uplift where accuracy improves consistently.

**Decision & action integration**
Dashboards with demand forecasts and confidence intervals.
Alerts for stockouts or procurement planning.
ERP integration to convert forecasts into actionable procurement and production plans.

**Governance, privacy & risk**
Validate historical sales and inventory data quality.
Monitor for drift due to new products or market changes.
Human oversight on forecast-based decisions.

**Success criteria**
High forecast accuracy, reduced stockouts, improved inventory turnover, measurable cost savings.

**Demo/POC outline**
Historical data slice (12–24 months).
Dashboard comparison: baseline vs. ML-enhanced forecast.
Scenario testing: seasonal peaks, supplier delays, production changes.

**Variants & extensions**
Multi-echelon supply chain forecasting.
Incorporate external market/competitor signals.
Link to production scheduling for optimization.
