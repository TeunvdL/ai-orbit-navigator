## Smart Website Search Agent

—**Short description**
Implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution with semantic vector search, dense reranking, and large language models to deliver grounded, citation-rich answers across a member-facing knowledge platform. The system supports policy-compliant “overrule” responses for sensitive topics and includes operational monitoring for safety and compliance.

**Business outcomes & KPIs**
Members receive instant, reliable answers from policy documents and handbooks without navigating information silos.
Increased self-service rates and reduced load on support staff.
Consistent, policy-aligned responses for sensitive or regulated topics.

**Example KPIs**
Self-service rate
p95 answer latency
Citation coverage %
Deflection rate vs. service desk

**Beneficiaries**
Members and end-users seeking information
Support and service desk teams
Policy and compliance officers

**Typical data & systems (examples)**
Knowledge base and policy corpus in a data lake or warehouse
Semantic vector search engine (e.g., Azure AI Search)
Large language models for answer synthesis
Operational monitoring and content safety tools

**Process (from data to action)**
Ingest and chunk knowledge base content into a vector index.
Generate embeddings and build a semantic search pipeline with reranking.
Use a system prompt and few-shot examples to guide answer generation.
Apply policy-compliant “overrule” responses for sensitive topics.
Monitor system health, content safety, and PII redaction.

**Modeling options**
Text-embedding models for vector search
Large language models (e.g., GPT-family) for answer synthesis
Hybrid search (vector + keyword)
Evaluation: grounding, citation accuracy, answer latency

**Decision & action integration**
Answers delivered with citations and policy compliance.
Automated “overrule” for restricted topics.
Integration with member portal or website.

**Governance, privacy & risk**
Strict grounding and citation thresholds to prevent hallucination.
Policy-compliant canned responses for sensitive topics.
Scheduled re-indexing and evaluation sets to monitor drift.
Content safety and PII redaction guardrails.

**Success criteria**
High self-service and citation coverage rates.
Consistent, policy-aligned answers.
Reduced support desk workload and positive member feedback.

**Demo/POC outline**
Pilot with a subset of policy documents and member queries.
Measure baseline vs. RAG-assisted answer quality and latency.
Iterate based on user feedback and expand coverage.

**Variants & extensions**
Expand to additional knowledge domains or user groups.
Integrate with chatbots or virtual assistants.
Enhance with multilingual support and advanced analytics.
